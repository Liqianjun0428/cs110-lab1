## self intro

My name is Qianjun Li. I am a independent person that loves programming. As a programmer I admire and follow the words of Louis Srygley:
> *Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file.*

## about lab1

in this lab we learned how to use git hub and markdown
for example:
Use 'git clone' to create a local copy of an remote repository.
Use 'git add' to stage changes
Use 'git commit' to commit changes
other git commands like:
'''
git status
git pull
git push
'''

for more git commands, refer to [Git commands](http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/version-control/common-git-commands.html).
